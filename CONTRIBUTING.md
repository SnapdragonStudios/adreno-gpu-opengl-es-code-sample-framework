## Contributing to the Adreno™ GPU OpenGL ES Code Sample Framework

Hi there!
We’re thrilled that you’d like to contribute to this project.
Your help is essential for keeping this project great and for making it better.

## Branching Strategy

In general, contributors should develop on branches based off of `master` and pull requests should be made against `master`.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Please read our [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) and [license](LICENSE.txt).
2. Fork and clone the repository.
3. Create a new branch based on `master`: `git checkout -b <my-branch-name> master`.
4. Make your changes, and test build and runtime on an Android device.
5. Commit your changes using the [DCO](http://developercertificate.org/). You can attest to the DCO by commiting with the **-s** or **--signoff** options or manually adding the "Signed-off-by".
6. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/quic/adreno-gpu-opengl-es-code-sample-framework/pulls) from your branch to `master`.
7. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request to be accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible.
  If you want to make multiple independent changes, please consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
